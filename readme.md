## Contribution and Recommendations

If you want to fix a bug or suggest an improvement you can fork and create a pull request.

If you want to add a new tool resource please follow the steps below:

- **Step 1.** Identify the tool and obtain all its general data: name, creators, sector that created the tool (public, NGO, academic or private), a short description, year of creation and all the links that you see necessary.

- **Step 2.** Analyze the tool to obtain the following data: type of ML task (regression, classification, computer vision, NLP, among others), the stages in which the tools can be used in the AI Life Cycle (of the five mentioned in article or website) and finally the high-level ethical principles to which the tool can contribute or ensure (five in total). It is also possible to list the related or low level principles.

- **Step 3.** Send all this data to the email ricardo.ortegab@autonoma.edu.co, which will be organized and reviewed and then the tool will be added. The level of development and type of tool will be assigned according to the criteria of the research group.
